## Challenge 1

Add a second heading to the page, and make the button change _that_ heading, instead of the first one. (Use a `class` or `id`.)

### Challenge 1, part 2

Make both headings change to different text.

## Homework 1

* Add a form to the page.
* Add a text input to the form.
* When the form is _submitted_, update the heading with the text you type in the text input.

### Bonus Credit

* Make sure it works when you press _enter_ on the keyboard, not just when you click the button.
